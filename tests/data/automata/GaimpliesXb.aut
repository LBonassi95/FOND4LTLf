State 1: 1X -> state 3
State 2: 0X -> state 2
State 2: 1X -> state 3
State 3: 00 -> state 4
State 3: 01 -> state 2
State 3: 10 -> state 4
State 3: 11 -> state 3
State 4: XX -> state 4
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
A               X 1
B               X X

A = {0}
B = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
A               X 0
B               X X

A = {}
B = {}
