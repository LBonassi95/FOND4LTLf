DFA for formula with free variables: A B
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 4
Rejecting states: 2 3
Don't-care states: 0 1

Automaton has 5 states and 6 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: XX -> state 1
State 1: 0X -> state 2
State 1: 1X -> state 3
State 2: 0X -> state 2
State 2: 1X -> state 3
State 3: X0 -> state 3
State 3: X1 -> state 4
State 4: XX -> state 4
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
A               X 0
B               X X

A = {}
B = {}

A satisfying example of least length (2) is:
A               X 1X
B               X X1

A = {0}
B = {1}
