DFA for formula with free variables: A
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 3
Rejecting states: 2
Don't-care states: 0 1

Automaton has 4 states and 4 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: X -> state 1
State 1: 0 -> state 2
State 1: 1 -> state 3
State 2: 0 -> state 2
State 2: 1 -> state 3
State 3: X -> state 3
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
A               X 0

A = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
A               X 1

A = {0}
