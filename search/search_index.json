It is also available online at fond4ltlfpltlf.diag.uniroma1.it . Prerequisites This tool is based on the following libraries: ltlf2dfa 1.0.1 ply click They are automatically added while installing FOND4LTL f /PLTL f . Install Intall from source ( master branch): pip install git+https://github.com/whitemech/FOND4LTLfPLTLf.git or, clone the repository and install: git clone https://github.com/whitemech/FOND4LTLfPLTLf.git cd fond4ltlfpltlf pip install . How To Use Use the command line interface: fond4ltlfpltlf -d <path/to/domain.pddl> -p <path/to/problem.pddl> -g \"formula\" You can also specify custom output paths for the new domain and the new problem using --out-domain or -outd and --out-problem or -outp . Features Syntax and parsing support FOND Planning in PDDL Compilation of Deterministic Finite-state Automaton into PDDL Tests To run tests: tox To run only the code tests: tox -e py3.8 To run only the code style checks: tox -e flake8 License FOND4LTL f /PLTL f is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 or later (LGPLv3+).
